Several approaches have been developed for improving the ship energy efficiency, thereby reducing operating costs and ensuring compliance with climate change mitigation regulations. Many of these approaches will heavily depend on measured data from onboard IoT devices, including operational and environmental information, as well as external data sources for more navigational data.
In this paper, we develop a framework that implements time-series analysis techniques to optimize the vessel's speed profile for improving the vessel's energy efficiency.
We present a case study involving a real-world data from a passenger vessel that was collected over a span of 15 months in the south of Sweden. 
The results indicate a potential enhancement can be achieved in the vessel's energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of optimizing the speed profile within the context of constrained landscapes, as often seen in short-sea shipping.
