# Requirements file for TSA4EESSS Project
# Generated for reproducibility based on code analysis.
# Target Python Version: 3.9.7

# --- Core Data Science Libraries ---
numpy==1.23.5          # Fundamental package for numerical computation
pandas==1.5.3          # Data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames)
scikit-learn==1.2.2    # Machine Learning (Preprocessing, KNN, Model Selection)

# --- Plotting Libraries ---
matplotlib==3.7.1      # Data visualization
seaborn==0.12.2         # Enhanced data visualization based on Matplotlib

# --- Time Series Specific Libraries ---
tslearn==0.6.0         # Time series analysis (DTW)
hmmlearn==0.3.0        # Hidden Markov Models

# --- Deep Learning Library (for LSTM) ---
# Note: Ensure compatibility with your CPU/GPU setup (tensorflow vs tensorflow-gpu)
# tensorflow 2.10 was one of the last versions officially supporting GPU on Native Windows.
# Use tensorflow-cpu if you don't need/have GPU support configured.
tensorflow==2.10.0     # Deep Learning framework (includes Keras for LSTM)
# keras==2.10.0         # Keras is typically bundled with tensorflow>=2.0

# --- Jupyter Environment (for running notebooks) ---
# Optional, but recommended for interacting with the .ipynb files
notebook==6.5.4        # Classic Jupyter Notebook interface
# or use jupyterlab
# jupyterlab==3.6.3

# --- Other Utilities (often implicitly installed, but good to specify) ---
ipykernel            # Required for Jupyter notebooks to run Python kernels
